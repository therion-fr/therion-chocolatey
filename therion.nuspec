    <description> Therion is a complete package which processes survey data and generates maps or 3D models of caves. It runs on wide variety of platforms: Linux, Windows, Mac OS X. It is completely free, released under the terms of GNU GPL, with source code available. It doesn't require any other commercial software to run.
    Therion solves the most annoying problem of cave cartography – how to keep a map of large and complicated cave system always up-to-date. Main features include:
    - Complete maps with all the detail. No additional ink stroke is needed.
    - Maps are dynamic, always up-to-date – i.e. they are automatically re-drawn after loop closure, blunder fix, scale or symbol set change.
    - 3D models are created using 2D maps.
